            So here we have a problem because we are trying to set a String value to a 
            Box object that is designed to hold an Integer value. This will result in a
            compile-time error, as the Box class is not designed to handle different data types. 
            To fix this issue, we can use generics to create a Box class that can hold any type of value. 
            Here's an example of how we can modify the Box class to use generics:
